## Hi there 👋, I'm Eylül!

I am a 2nd-year Computer Engineering student with a solid academic foundation in algorithms, data structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (C/C++, Java). 

Right now, my biggest excitement is stepping into the world of **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning**. I am currently taking my first steps to build my skills in this area from the ground up. I am looking for voluntary summer internship opportunities where I can learn from experienced professionals, apply my engineering background, and grow in a data-driven environment.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To:
* **Learning:** Starting my journey in Python, data manipulation, and visualization through a comprehensive 50-hour bootcamp.
* **Coding:** Building a daily coding habit by pushing my beginner-level Python exercises to my learning repository.
* **Improving:** Enhancing my C++ algorithmic visualization projects.

### 🛠️ My Current Toolbox:
* **Strong Foundation:** C++, Java, C, Algorithm Analysis, Data Structures
* **Currently Learning:** Python for Data Science
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
